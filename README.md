# Updated for new Discord Classes 3/28/2024

changes discord watermark (on title bar)

changes home icon

removes pointless discord shit

removed almost all nitro features and upsells

way to "block" users without actually doing so (aka have an annoying friend just removes their messages from chat until you clear it)


and special settings to show friends you actually care for, by either A) Custom Color B) Custom Name C) Custom Icon (20x20 ideally) 




check commits to see stuff that have been removed that you may or may not enjoy, typically its just extra things you can do, but some stuff has been removed that i no longer prefer having

Recommended to use a [transparent theme](https://github.com/s-k-y-l-i/discord-themes) with this, either on [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord) or [Equicord (vencord+)](https://github.com/Equicord/Equicord) if Equicord fails to build, just delete whatever plugin caused the issue, for me it was Picture in Picture, which was completely useless to me anyways. 

[transparent.css is s-k-y-l-i's transparent theme](https://github.com/s-k-y-l-i/discord-themes/blob/main/Theme%20code/transparency.css) with updated classes

[clear.css is clearvisions theme](https://clearvision.github.io/ClearVision-v6/main.css) with updated classes

[Apatheia (found on this archived repo)](https://github.com/AmadeusWM/dotfiles-hyprland/blob/main/dots/BetterDiscord/Apatheia.theme.css) is [ultra](https://github.com/TheCommieAxolotl/BetterDiscord-Stuff/blob/main/Ultra/Ultra.theme.css) but recolored.
